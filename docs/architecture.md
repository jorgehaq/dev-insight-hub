# DevInsightHub Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of DevInsightHub, a code quality analysis platform.

## Overview

DevInsightHub is designed as a cloud-native application that analyzes code quality and patterns. The system is composed of multiple services that work together to provide a comprehensive analysis of code repositories.

## Components

### Backend API

- **FastAPI Application**: Provides RESTful endpoints for user interaction
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **Repository Management**: Endpoints for managing code repositories
- **Analysis Triggers**: Endpoints to initiate code analysis

### Analysis Engine

- **Code Parsers**: AST-based code analysis for Python
- **Quality Analyzers**: Metrics for code quality and complexity
- **Pattern Detection**: Identification of code patterns and anti-patterns

### Worker System

- **Celery Workers**: Asynchronous task processing
- **Redis Queue**: Message broker for task distribution
- **MongoDB Storage**: Stores analysis results

### Frontend

- **React Application**: Responsive UI for viewing analysis results
- **Dashboard**: Visualization of code quality metrics
- **Repository Explorer**: Navigate and view code with annotations

### GitHub Integration

- **Webhooks**: Real-time triggers for code analysis on push events
- **API Integration**: Repository browsing and content fetching

## Data Flow

1. User authenticates and registers repositories for analysis
2. System clones repositories or receives webhook notifications
3. Analysis tasks are queued and distributed to workers
4. Workers analyze code and store results in MongoDB
5. Frontend displays results through API queries

## Database Schema

### PostgreSQL (Relational Data)

- **Users**: Authentication and profile information
- **Repositories**: Repository metadata and access control
- **Settings**: User and system configuration

### MongoDB (Analysis Results)

- **Analyses**: Complete analysis results
- **Metrics**: Aggregated quality metrics
- **Issues**: Detected code problems

## Deployment

The system is designed to be deployed in various environments:

- **Development**: Docker Compose for local development
- **Production**: Kubernetes for orchestration or AWS serverless for cloud deployment

## Security Considerations

- JWT authentication with proper expiration
- Data validation and sanitization
- Secure GitHub webhook integration
- Role-based access control
